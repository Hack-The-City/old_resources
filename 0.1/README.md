# Hack The City Spring 2016
=========================
#### Some things to keep in mind:
1. Do not alter the `style.css` file in the CSS folder. This is compiled Sass. Sass is super straightforward to learn and 100x better than CSS. To learn more, click [this](http://sass-lang.com/guide).
2. When you alter `style.sass`, make sure to run `gulp styles`. This will compile the Sass into CSS.
3. Please work in branches, and use `git add .` sparingly. It is good practice to add files one by one and use Pull-Requests. If you're unfamiliar with version control, talk to either [Dana](https://twitter.com/danagilliann) or [Chuk](devchuk.github.io).

#### How to "run" the site:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install `npm` and `gulp`
To installing npm, read [this](https://www.npmjs.com/).
To install gulp, make sure you have `npm` installed and then run:
```
npm install -g gulp
```
This will install gulp on your computer.
3. Run `gulp` on the command-line
4. If you don't run into errors, open the `index.html` file
5. Party!
